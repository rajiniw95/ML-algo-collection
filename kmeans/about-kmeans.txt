K-MEANS ALGORITHM
=============================================================

The k-means clustering method is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify clusters of data objects in a dataset, which can be used for knowledge discovery.

The Algorithm 
-------------------------------------------------------------
K-Means(k, Data):
	Randomly choose k cluster center locations (centroids) 
	Loop until convergence {
		Assign each point to the closest cluster of the closest centroid
		Reestimate the cluster centroids based on the data assigned to each
	}

The quality of the cluster assignments is determined by computing the sum of the squared error (SSE) after the centroids converge, or match the previous iterationâ€™s assignment. The SSE is defined as the sum of the squared Euclidean distances of each point to its closest centroid. Since this is a measure of error, the objective of k-means is to try to minimize this value.

Problems with K-Means
-------------------------------------------------------------
Very sensitive to initial points. Therefore, choosing an appropriate number of centroids in important for the success of the algorithm. There are two methods for number of centoid selection;
	1. The elbow method
    	2. The silhouette coefficient

These are often used as complementary evaluation techniques rather than one being preferred over the other. To perform the elbow method, run several k-means, increment k with each iteration, and record the SSE.
